# SDF Utils

Few SDF miscellaneous stuff:
* `mdsdf` - an implementation of a multidimensional sdf
* `milp_formulation` - a MILP that optimizes throughput, but can be augmented with other constraints
* `buffer_sizing` - augmentation of the MILP to enable constrained buffers
* `cyclic_scheduling` - augmentation of the MILP to enable cyclic scheduling
